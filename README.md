- 👋 Hi, I’m dushyantsinghraghav
- 👀 I’m interested in data analysis , data wrangling , machine learning algorithms and deep learning .
- 🌱 I’m currently learning tensorflow library and using it on MNIST , Abalone  as well as CIFAR10  dataset. Moreover i am currently focussing on using Tensorflow for 
      CNN(Convolution neural networks ), RNN(Recurrent Neural Networks ) , LTSM as well as for NLP & computer vision.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on  RNN, CNN and NLP . Moreover i am looking to use tensorflow as pytorch projects.
